# Need-Mask

## Why
We founded [need-mask](http://need-mask.com/) to fight cut throat prices for medical masks back in April 2020, when Europe faced a shortage of medical gear due to the corona pandemic. Need-mask is a basic listing platform where suppliers and buyers of medical equipment can negotiate deals. The architecture of the platform was discussed in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QJoNZ35us8) at the 2020 Hasura conference by Fabian.
